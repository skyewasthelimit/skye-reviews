        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed by Sabotage Studio, Sea of Stars was another crowd funded Kickstarter success and a solid
        standout entry in the heavy hitting line up of 2023 game releases.
      <br></br>
      <h3>Gameplay</h3>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavily inspired title, Sea of Stars draws influence from
      excellent retro titles such as Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG. You can expect
      to see enemies on the area maps and engage in turn-based combat directly
      on the scene. The usage of timed hits and defends makes for engaging and often tense
      battles. Though, rarely did I feel the need to grind, you are able to respawn enemies by leaving
      and re-entering an area. Players can expect to level up and make choices in 
      building their characters abilities to their liking. The game does offer
      open-world exploration but it is designed as a linear experience. You will utilize
      items, gear and cooking recipes to make the best of your adventures. Sea of Stars
      has a large amount of boss fights that are fair and balanced and will put your abilities to the
      test. Similar to Chrono Trigger you can use combo attacks with your party members however, unlike
      Chrono Trigger you can swap party members in and out during combat much like you would in Pokemon.
      My personal feelings are I wish there were a few more abilities to use because I often ended up only
      using a few main abilities myself for each character. You can take advantage of a bonfire mechanic to
      replenish your party's health and mana.

      <h3>Music & Sound</h3>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabotage studios was able to get legendary composer Yasunori Mitsuda to contribute a number of
      tracks to Sea of Stars which really helped encapsulate the nostalgic feel and vibe of the game.
      In combination with in-house composer Eric W. Brown the music is on point and gives a great soundscape
      that is a pleasure to listen to through each area and boss fight. You never feel the music unsuiting and you're always
      excited to hear the next track when it comes in. The sounds are satisfying and every timed hit is punctuated by
      a timing indicator noise that sits just right in the mix. I loved the sounds of Sea of Stars and the music especially
      compliments this beautifully rendered game.

      <h3>Story</h3>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking place within The Messenger universe, Sea of Stars story visits a few different themes including: grief, growth, friendship, pirates and of course the 
      always cliche - saving the world. Your adventure will take you to a variety of locations and biomes including snow, dessert, tropical islands deep deep under the ocean and 
      many more! You follow the story of two heroes named Valere and Zale
      who possess the powers of the moon and the sun which they harness to fight evil forces. Your journey is adjoined by several companions you meet along the way.
      I think my personal favourite was Garl who is the childhood friend of the main characters and is the main chef of the party and an enthusiastic and positive influence
      on the group throughout. Sea of Stars does a great job of incorporating a few mind bending elements such as time travel along the way to create a rich
      and entertaining experience for the player. The storytelling is strong and delivers the point but can often be a bit overly cheery and some of the character development
      was not mature enough for my taste but there are many parts that left a great impact as a whole.
      <h2>Final Rating: 7.5 / 10</h2>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall I had an awesome time with Sea of Stars and it has plenty of content to offer including an end game arc for players wanting a bit more. A genuinely 
      fun game with great retro appeal for the JRPG lover.
